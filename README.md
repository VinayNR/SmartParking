# SmartParking
A simple implementation of a smart reservation parking system.
Built an Android app for the user so the they can reserve parking slots based on the avaiability.(Used Android Studio - Intellij)
Created a physical model of a parking lot with 3 slots, using Arduino as a microcontroller and a hc-05 bluetooth module to communicate with the android device.
The depiction of the status of the parking lot is done by LEDs(Red-unavailable, Green-available and Blinking-reserved), and likewise is shown on the app buttons.
The .ino file has also been uploaded with respect to the pin numbers we have used.
The bluetooth on your android device must be switched on before the app is opened, and connection(pairing) between the module an device must be done before the app is started.
